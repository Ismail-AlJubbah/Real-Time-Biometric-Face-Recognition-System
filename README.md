Real Time Biometric Face Recognition System

Real Time Biometric Authentication using Face Recognition has been a challenging problem for computer vision area. Many previous works have the capability of verifying human faces, but the main task in this research is not only a computer vision system with Face Recognition capability it is also to provide a real-time Biometric authentication with high accuracy using obtained information from the moving object in the scene.

Our Face Detection algorithm is implemented using the information of the moving object in the scene. The algorithm identification ability gained by analyzing the moving object and depends on extracting the contour of the moving object then comparing it with previously saved samples.

 In order to overcome the statistical based methods problems and to achieve biometric recognition, we depend on building a facial mesh between the eyes, nose, mouth, eyebrows,and extracting the shape of each. Then this mesh will be used later in the recognition process. Face area is passed through a number of preprocessing steps such as noise reduction, scale process and unifying the illumination of the face to obtain better results during the eye, nose, mouth and eyebrow search process.
